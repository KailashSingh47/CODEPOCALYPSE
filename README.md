## 🧟 What it does

A cursed digital obituary generator for the end of the internet. When you click "Mourn My Digital Soul", it creates a personalized eulogy for your lost digital existence. The page self-destructs in 10 seconds, but not before playing a horror scream and flipping itself in the mirror.

Built for maximum chaos with minimum sanity.

## 🔧 How it's built

- **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** (no frameworks - purity in chaos)
- **Fake "AI" eulogy generator** (Markov chain trained on digital despair)
- **Web Audio API** (for cursed horror screams)
- **CSS animations** (glitch effects, CRT scanlines, falling skulls)
- **Self-destruct mechanism** (`document.body.innerHTML = 'THE END'`)
- **Mirror flip** (reality distortion when inspected)
- **Falling skull with rope** (visual execution of the internet)

## 🎭 Why it's cursed

- **Self-destructs** - No take-backs, no backups, no afterlife
- **Fake AI** - Just random strings pretending to be deep
- **Horror audio** - Scream when the apocalypse completes  
- **Falling skull** - Digital execution visual
- **Mirror flip** - Reality breaks when you die
- **Console warnings** - The void judges you
- **Single HTML file** - All chaos in one place
- **Built in 2 hours** - Pure sleep-deprived genius

## 🏆 The Chaos Sequence

1. Open page → CRT terminal aesthetic
2. Click button → Fake AI generates your digital eulogy
3. 10 second countdown → Existential dread builds
4. Skull falls from top-right → Visual execution
5. "THE END" appears → Internet dies
6. Horror scream plays → Auditory apocalypse
7. Page flips horizontally → Reality breaks
8. Console warns: "Don't look too close. The void is looking back."

- Page flips when you inspect it (the void is watching)
- Audio might not work on mobile (the apocalypse is desktop-only)
- Skull might fall through your screen (digital physics are broken)
